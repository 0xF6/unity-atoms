# ⚛️ Unity Atoms
*Tiny modular pieces utilizing the power of Scriptable Objects*

# Influences
Unity Atoms is derrived from and a continuation of Ryan Hipple's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk&t=2787s) from Unite 2017. The original source code can be found [here](https://github.com/roboryantron/Unite2017).

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmRwLYWNRo&t=738s) talk by Richard Fine is a forerunner to Ryan Hipple's talk during Unite 2017.

# Motivation
The general approach to building scripts in Unity often generates a code base that is monolithic. This results in that your code is cumbersome to test, non-modular and hard to debug and understand.

Unity Atoms is an open source library that aims to make your game code become: 
- 📦 Modular *- avoid scripts and systems directly dependent on each other*
- ✏️ Editable *- Scriptable Objects makes it possible to make changes to your game at runtime*
- 🐞 Debuggable *- modular code is easier to debug than tightly coupled code*

# Introduction
Before you start looking into this library you should watch the video above ☝️ and read [this](https://unity3d.com/how-to/architect-with-scriptable-objects) article on how to architect your game with Scriptable Objects.
