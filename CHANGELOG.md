# [Unreleased]

# 2.0.0 (September 3, 2019)

-   The repo has been split up to 5 different packages: core, mobile, scene-mgmt, tags and ui
-   None generic base classes for all atoms
-   Generator to generate new atoms with ease ðŸš€ Could be found under Tools / Unity Atoms / Generator.
-   Custom icons for all atoms. The solution is not 100%, but is good enough for now.
-   MonoHooks are no more ðŸ’€ After some discussions and thoughts it has been decided that the value they bring is not worth it.
-   Custom property drawers for all atoms.
-   Variables now discards playmode changes.
-   Add public method `Reset` to Variables.

# 1.0.0 (Mars 17, 2019)

-   Unity Atoms is now using UPM (Unity Package Manager) - see the README on the new and improved way to use and depend on Unity Atoms
-   Conditional Functions - Check a condition before executing an action.
-   Molecules - Larger constructs / sets of atoms and other ScriptableObjects. First Molecule added is the Timer.
-   Moved editor scripts to separate folder
-   Rearranged the structure of Unity Atoms. Scripts are now on the highest level separated on type (int, float, etc.) instead of on concept (Game Event, Variables, etc.). This seems like a more natural way of structuring the project and makes it easier for developers to include / exclude the relevant stuff for their project.
-   New type called TouchUserInput that keeps track of a userâ€™s touch input. There is also a possibility to detect tap / double tap.
-   Added new MonoHooks, for example OnPointerDownHook, OnButtonClickHook, OnTriggerStay and OnTriggerEnter.
-   Added SetStringVariableValue
-   Added type Collider
-   Added UIContainer
-   AtomicTags - Use tags the Unity Atoms way.
